    "In 1912, the ship RMS Titanic struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank, resulting in the deaths of most of its passengers and crew. In this introductory project, we will explore a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive. To complete this project, you will need to implement several conditional predictions and answer the questions below. Your project submission will be evaluated based on the completion of the code and your responses to the questions.\n",

    "# Getting Started\n",
    "To begin working with the RMS Titanic passenger data, we'll first need to `import` the functionality we need, and load our data into a `pandas` DataFrame.  \n",
    "Run the code cell below to load our data and display the first few entries (passengers) for examination using the `.head()` function.\n",
    "> **Tip:** You can run a code cell by clicking on the cell and using the keyboard shortcut **Shift + Enter** or **Shift + Return**. Alternatively, a code cell can be executed using the **Play** button in the hotbar after selecting it. Markdown cells (text cells like this one) can be edited by double-clicking, and saved using these same shortcuts. [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) allows you to write easy-to-read plain text that can be converted to HTML."

    "Using just the **Sex** feature for each passenger, we are able to increase the accuracy of our predictions by a significant margin. Now, let's consider using an additional feature to see if we can further improve our predictions. For example, consider all of the male passengers aboard the RMS Titanic: Can we find a subset of those passengers that had a higher rate of survival? Let's start by looking at the **Age** of each male, by again using the `survival_stats` function. This time, we'll use a fourth parameter to filter out the data so that only passengers with the **Sex** 'male' will be included.  \n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot the survival outcomes of male passengers based on their age."

    "Adding the feature **Age** as a condition in conjunction with **Sex** improves the accuracy by a small margin more than with simply using the feature **Sex** alone. Now it's your turn: Find a series of features and conditions to split the data on to obtain an outcome prediction accuracy of at least 80%. This may require multiple features and multiple levels of conditional statements to succeed. You can use the same feature multiple times with different conditions.   \n",
    "**Pclass**, **Sex**, **Age**, **SibSp**, and **Parch** are some suggested features to try.\n",

    "Use the `survival_stats` function below to to examine various survival statistics.  \n",
    "**Hint:** To use mulitple filter conditions, put each condition in the list passed as the last argument. Example: `[\"Sex == 'male'\", \"Age < 18\"]`"

    "**Answer**:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method\n",
    "I started with the initial classifications provided in `predictions_1` and `predictions_2`: *\"Sex == 'Female'\"* and *\"Age < 10\"*. From here, I noticed that a `Pclass` of '1' seemed to indicate a higher probability of survival. That by itself was not enough to reach the 80% threshhold, so I continued slicing the data from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I saw that *some* of those with `Parch` of '2' survived at a greater rate. Continuing my slicing, I narrowed this subgroup down to those with a `SibSp` equal to '3' *and* who paid a `Fare` less than 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the group whose `Parch` was *not* 2 (i.e. `Parch` equaled '1' or '3'), those who paid a `Fare` between 20 and 60 had a higher rate of survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these classifications helped the algorithm pass the 80% success benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusions\n",
    "I suspect that the `Fare` values were correlated with each passenger's location on the ship, thus giving those with certain `Fare` values a greater chance of being close to a lifeboat when the ship was evacuated. Women and children were given first priority. Of the men, those who were of higher rank had a greater chance than those of low.\n",

    "#### Prediction Accuracy\n",
    "Predictions have an accuracy of 80.02%."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "After several iterations of exploring and conditioning on the data, you have built a useful algorithm for predicting the survival of each passenger aboard the RMS Titanic. The technique applied in this project is a manual implementation of a simple machine learning model, the *decision tree*. A decision tree splits a set of data into smaller and smaller groups (called *nodes*), by one feature at a time. Each time a subset of the data is split, our predictions become more accurate if each of the resulting subgroups are more homogeneous (contain similar labels) than before. The advantage of having a computer do things for us is that it will be more exhaustive and more precise than our manual exploration above. [This link](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/) provides another introduction into machine learning using a decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is just one of many models that come from *supervised learning*. In supervised learning, we attempt to use features of the data to predict or model things with objective outcome labels. That is to say, each of our data points has a known outcome value, such as a categorical, discrete label like `'Survived'`, or a numerical, continuous value like predicting the price of a house.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5\n",
    "*Think of a real-world scenario where supervised learning could be applied. What would be the outcome variable that you are trying to predict? Name two features about the data used in this scenario that might be helpful for making the predictions.*  "

    "**Answer**: I think supervised learning could be applied to predicting the generation of surfable ocean waves based on global weather conditions and ocean floor contours. The outcome variable would be a `breaking wave` boolean at a given location. Some of the features that feed into this prediction would be: *swell height*, *swell direction*, *ocean floor depth*, etc.\n",
